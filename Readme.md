# Baedoor Licenses
Welcome in repository storing custom licenses made by Toma400. This specific
branch focuses on Baedoor licenses which cover specific chunk of Toma400's
creations.

### Why Baedoor Licenses?
I made Baedoor Licenses to solve the problem of getting somewhere in between
ARR and GNU/MIT licenses. The first one was too restrictive, meanwhile more
open variants were too loose. Also, they all missed this individual touch
I wanted for my things.

So, this is also why would you want to use those licenses: they try to give
some freedom to user, while also preserving rights and credit, as ARR do.

### Can I use any of Baedoor Licenses?
You can use Baedoor Mod License freely, with possibly section 4 ommited, but
any changes to the license (except typos) should be mentioned at the start
of the document. This is so people know there are differences in original
license.

Baedoor License has a bit hermetic use, so if you use it for things not being
Baedoor-related, you will need to modify it heavily, I'm afraid.  
Again, in such case, I request you to notify the readers about that explicitly.  
It is totally possible for you to use it, though, if you see purpose for it.
